FreeRTOS for the STM32F4 in CooCox IDE

I was surprised to not find a CooCox project that had FreeRTOS running out the box for the STM32F4, so I have uploaded this so that one can quickly test out FreeRTOS. 

A neat button-debouncing technique is used to test FreeRTOS - pressing a button toggles LED4.
